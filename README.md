# 🚖 Ola Ride Booking Analysis Dashboard | SQL + Power BI

## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes **33.46K ride bookings** using **MySQL** and **Power BI** to uncover insights related to booking performance, revenue generation, customer behavior, vehicle utilization, cancellations, and service quality.

The objective is to transform raw booking data into actionable business insights through data cleaning, SQL analysis, and interactive dashboarding.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms generate large volumes of operational data daily. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

* Monitor booking performance
* Track revenue trends
* Understand cancellation patterns
* Evaluate vehicle category utilization
* Measure customer satisfaction

This dashboard provides a centralized view of key business metrics to support data-driven decision-making.
